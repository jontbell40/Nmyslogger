A simple logger in myphon to connect to mysql

I Recently had a customer demonstration, as with most demonstrations after weeks of success, it when badly. Tests that had not failed for weeks fell over. 
The difficult part was it was difficult for them to feel confident that this was the case because our logs were spread across individual developer machines.
One possible solution would be to capture in a database all test runs, showing the reduction in failures as we approach a delivery. 

The tests themselves do not require fast operation, the equipment itself needs to have elements removed and settings altered, so speed is not an issue.


##Todo

1. Add the ability to store files to an evidence folder.
2. Test multi test connections.
3. Align the logging to our needs.
4.
